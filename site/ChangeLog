    * Added new image (mainfd-3.gif) that includes the phone number on it.
    * Changed the bol.php to point to the new image added.
    * Major addition of the way we present and price additional services.
      - There is a section just below the rating portion of the my page that
        lists all the possible additional services and their prices. Each one
        has a checkbox next to it.
      - These values are posted to the next page, rating.php, that includes a
        subtotal of the at the upper right along with a new total that is the
        sum of the base rate and all additional services. All of the options
        here are agained stored in hidden fields to be passed to the next page.
      - The next page, schedule.php, has changes in the way the additional
        services were changed. Rather than a 'drop-down' type of list, they are
        now presented in checkboxes. This was done for 2 reasons, the first is
        to be consistent since they were presented as checkboxes 2 pages
        before. The second was that a drop-down type of box can't have the
        values set to any defaults, checkboxes can. That way the user's choices
        so far were reflected on this page. The total on the top right of the
        page now reflects the rate price, services and a sum of the two as a
        total.
