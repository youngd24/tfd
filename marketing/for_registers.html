We wanted to drop you a note and thank you for registering with The Freight Depot. 
<br><br>
Since the time you have registered The Freight Depot has made numerous upgrades in our on-line 
systems and improved pricing in many of the lanes that we service. 
<br><br>
The Freight Depot offers shippers less than truckload (LTL) shipping as well as truckload, 
airfreight and international services. 
<br><br>
We would ask that you take the time and re-visit our site and review some of the improvements we 
have made making shipping freight easier and more cost effective than ever. 
<br><br>
