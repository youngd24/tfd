INTRODUCTION
------------

This directory contains various PHP related configuration files such as the
main php.ini file. For a standard RedHat machine this file will go into /etc,
however if php was compiled from source it could be just about anywhere.
Typically though it's palced in /usr/local/lib by the standard php installation
script.

The makefile in this directory should contain most of the inherent knowledge on
where the files are supposed to reside based on the environment, machine and
applications to be deployed. These are specific to The Freight Depot.
