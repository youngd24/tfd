INTRODUCTION
------------

This directory contains various system configuration files and scripts. Some
are OS related while others are aplication specific. Many of them are tailored
to a specific environment and dealt with mostly by makefiles throughout the
sub-directories.

Do not modify the critical configuration files directly, do that in here. Once
you have your changes in place use the makefiles in here to install them to the
required location. This is the best way to modify critical system and
application configuration files since it enables you to revert to the previous
version fairly easily.
