# The Freight Depot

The Freight Depot, referred to here as "tfd", was a startup I worked at around 2003 and was loosely based on the application from a previous startup named Digiship.

## Why?

The code here is REALLY old, like 15+ years old, and likely won't even work on a modern system. It's here for posterity, partially for me, and for the rest of the Internet. It's also here to show people my coding style, especially those I might go to work for. Call it a REALLY OLD resume.
