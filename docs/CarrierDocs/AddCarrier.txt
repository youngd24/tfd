Process to add a carrier to the Freight Depot system

Darren Young [darren_young@yahoo.com]

===============================================================================


OVERVIEW
--------

This document will explain the process that should be employed to add
a new freight carrier to the Freight Depot production system. It will
guide you through the process by using a real example of a carrier
that was added. The example carrier, Parker Motor Freight, was added
in September 2002 by me. If all goes well, by the end of this document
there should be enough information available to automate the process
almost entirely. Although, there really isn't much of a reason to
spend time scripting the addition process since we don't add carriers
all that often.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The following pieces of information are required to complete the
carrier addition process.

1) The carrier information such as:
   - Name
   - Address
   - SCAC Code
   - Negotiated Margin
   - Minimum Order Amount

2) The "lanes" or "corridors", commonly referred to as XXX, that the
   carrier services. This will be the zip codes that the carrier is
   capable of picking up and delivering shipments to/from. This is
   typically available from the carrier in an electronic format either
   from their sales or customer service department. In the case of Parker
   Motor Freight they sent us an electronic version (flat text file) that is
   in the PAMF directory just below this file.

3) The database connection information for the production database. You must
   have permissions to INSERT into the production database.


ADD CARRIER INFO
----------------

Here's the layout of the carriers table in the database where you'll be adding
the new information to:

+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field       | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| carrierid   | mediumint(4) |      | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| name        | tinytext     | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| discount    | int(2)       | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| scac        | varchar(4)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| type        | int(1)       | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| description | text         | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| minimum     | float(4,2)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| ccscac      | varchar(4)   | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| ormargin    | int(2)       | YES  |     | -1      |                |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

One thing to note: carrierid is auto-magically created via the
auto_increment field setting so you don't need to add that.

Most of the information came from the carrier with the exception of the
discount and margin which came from Tom. This is part of the negotiation
process thet handled with them directly.

carrierid    = auto-generated
name         = Parker Motor Freight
discount     = 70
scac         = PAMF
type         = 3
description  = Midwest LTL Carrier
minimum      = 80.00
ccscac       = PAMF
ormargin     = 2

So, in the case of our example of Parker Motor Freight we'll be inserting a
row as follows:

INSERT INTO carriers VALUES ('',\
                             'Parker Motor Freight',\
                             70,\
                             'PAMF',\
                             3,\
                             'Midwest LTL Carrier',\
                             80.00,\
                             PAMF,\
                             2);

Add that to the database and commit.

Run a select to make sure the record was added and take note of the carrierid
that was generated during the insert, you'll need that for the next step of
the process. As long as the record is in there correctly, you're done with
this step of the process.


ADD ZIPS
--------

The next step is to add the zip codes that the carrier services to the
database. There are 2 tables that need to be updated, zips and zips2 in the
database. zips is used to track the "left" or origin side of the corridor and
zips2 is used to track the "right", or destination side. When you line these 2
up together you end up with the full profile of where a given carrier
services.

Now, this part of the process is almost completely dependent on the format in
which the carrier delivers their lane information to you. In the case of PAMF,
they sent us a flat text file that listed the zips and the terminal associated
with that zip. Here's a snippet from the file they supplied to us:

14001
BUFF
14004
BUFF

All we really need from it is a listing of the zip codes, however the terminal
might come in handy later. So, I created a small little script to clean out
the terminal information and write out just the zips to a new flat text file.
How you get to the end result really doesn't matter, so long as what you end
up with is a file that contains lines with the zips.
