This is all really old code. Parts have been robbed to make the new EDI Server.

Originally, we wanted to create our own FTP server which is mostly done
in this code. The remote would simply issue a SITE EDI command to throw
the server into EDI mode, otherwise it would act like a regular FTP server.

Well, I didn't have time to maintain that code at The Freight Depot like I
did at Digiship, so I dumped it and decided to use a "regular" FTP server. 
Actually, this is a much better way of doing it since most OS FTP servers
have much more functionality than could be written quickly. That, and it
can run on MS or UNIX with whatever FTP server you want.

Anyways, check the directory ../EDIServer for the newer one.

Oh, and the XMLEDI modules are pretty much crap at this point. The XMLEDI
document structure has changed a lot since these were written.
