#
# Format & Usage:
#
# This is the main configuration file for the EDI FTP Server program. It is
# similar in form to other UNIX as well as Digiship configuration files in
# that it is a plain text file and uses name=value pairs to set run-time
# options.
#
# If the server encounters any settings that it doesn't recognize, or are set
# to something not understood, they will be ignored. If you think something is
# wrong with a setting, use the server's -d switch to see the config file
# parsing in "real time".
#
# This file is meant to be a set of sane defaults that are known to work under
# most conditions. This does not mean that they will work under all
# circumstances, which is why this exists in the first place. Be careful when
# you do change these as the defaults have been tested to more than anything
# else.
#
# Most of the settings are grouped by category to make it easier to understand
# and control. In addition to this, most of them have been commented with
# the specifics on what it is they do and what other alternate settings could
# be.
#
# As mentioned before, the settings are in name = value pairs. The name itself
# may be any string up to 256 characters and may contain some special
# characters such as _ and -. By all means though, refrain from using any
# characters such as $ % ^ & * % @ or ! in the names or values as that will
# have a negative impact on the server.
#
# The value may be of any basic Perl data type such as a string or number,
# another variable within the configuration file or even a new server variable.
# Again, these should be the Perl standard data types such as a string ($), an
# array (@) or a hash (%). Remember to use '' to enclose strings, especially
# if they have spaces in them. If you do opt to use Perl datatypes in the
# value portion, you might want to take the additional step of protecting the
# value by escaping (\) it first, as in: name = \$value.
#
# If you wish to add new settings to this file, you will have to add the
# necessary Config parsing code to the server itself. The server uses a module
# that I developed for this purpose called Config and should be located in the
# module repository on the deployed machine or in the development environment.
# It has detailed POD documentation containted within it and there are several
# other program Digiship has deployed that uses it. Worst case, look at how
# it's done in the EDI FTP Server.
