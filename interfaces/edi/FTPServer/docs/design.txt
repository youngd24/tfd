INTRODUCTION

The server in its basic form is a standard FTP server. It will accept connections from RFC959
standard FTP clients and will look as any other FTP server. They differences are that it only 
implements a subset of the FTP commands and it parses the inbound XML and stores them in the
database.

THE PROCESS

Listen for incoming connections on TCP port 21.
Authenticate users from a password file (or the database).
Upon a client issuing a STOR command, ask for the remote TCP port to send to.
Check permissions for requested file and directory.
If permissions are ok, initiate a connection to the client at that port.
Retrieve the file.
If the document is one of the XMLEDI docs, spawn a thread to:
	Validate it against the DTD.
		If bad:
			Send the client the FTP upload error code.
		If good:
			Parse the doc to retrieve:
				doctype, revid, sender, shipnum, ponum
			If the revid is not supported:
				Send the client the FTP upload error code.
			If the revid is supported:
				Store the doc:
					In the directory for the sender SCAC
					Filename as doctype-shipnum-ponum.xml
				Send the client the FTP OK to proceed code

Spawn a thread to process the file
	Parse the XML document and store in the database
