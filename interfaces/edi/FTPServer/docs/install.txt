INSTALLATION
============

LINUX
-----

For a Linux based installation, all of this has been tested against a RedHat 6.2 machine with
current RedHat patches and Glibc 2.1.1. To start off, the factory Perl installation must be 
removed since it's version 5.00503 and we have to run against Perl 5.6.0 at least. The reason
is because of our constant use of the 'our' command as well as certain modules.

Now, the first item ot overcome is how to install the new Perl interpreter. You can simply 
obtain the source code and compile/install that or opt for an RPM. The downside of the source
based installation is the fact that it is difficult to remove. The downside of the RPM is that
there isn't one available from RedHat for 6.2. To overcome these issues, I simply created an RPM
for Perl 5.6 based on the SPEC file that ships with RedHat 7.0 (since it includes Perl 5.6). It's
currently located in the sysops/install directory for installation. It hasn't been thoroughly
tested against 6.2, but I see no reason for it to cause problems.

The first thing to do is to remove the old version. If you simply try to erase the package
using RPM it won't work. RedHat keeps tracks of the dependencies between RPM packages and
there are quite a few that require Perl. So, to get around this, use the --nodeps option
for RPM: rpm --erase --nodeps perl and it should work.

Next, install the Perl 5.6 RPM package from the sysops install location with: rpm -ivh perl-5.6.rpm
and that's it. If you wish to see the files it installs do an rpm -qilp on the file itself.

Next are the required moduls and their underlying libraries. These all have to be installed
for the server to operate. If you don't follow this and install them, it won't work.

Let's start with the Expat library. It may be obtained from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat, I used 0.95-1 for this document. Download it somewhere that
you can use to build it from, let's say /usr/local/build. cd to /usr/local/build and execute:
tar -zxvf expat-0.95-1.tar.gz. Next, cd into export-0.95-1 and execute ./configure. When that's
complete, run make then make install. That should put the libraries in /usr/local/lib and the 
headers in /usr/local/include for future reference.

Next, let's move on to the required Perl modules. First is the module that actually uses the library
that we just installed, XML::Parser. The best way to download and work with Perl modules on UNIX is
to use the CPAN module. This is true if you're not using the ActiveState Perl distribution for 
Linux which comes with a utility called PPM that does the same job. We're assuming here that you're
not using the ActiveState Perl, but our Perl 5.6 RPM.

To launch CPAN, execute: perl -MCPAN -eshell from the command line. The first time it is run you'll
be prompted for a tremendous amount of information. Fill it in and get to the cpan> prompt. The 
first time you run it, you should obtain a copy of the index, so do: reload index. After that's done
build the list of bundles with: autobundle. When that's done, obtain and install a fresh copy of
CPAN with: install Bundle::CPAN. When it's done, you'll be prompted for the same configuration
info that you filled in earlier. Yes, you have to do it again, I don't know why. After you return
to the cpan> prompt, install the libnet package: install Bundle::libnet. When you get back to the
cpan> prompt you;re ready to go.

Let's install the XML::Parser library manually first so simply do: get XML::Parser. That will simply
download and untar the package into the cpan cache directory. When that's down, let's go to that
directory and work on it manualy with: look XML::Parser which simply launches a shell in the
correct directory. Next we have to build the Makefile for the build to work with:
	Perl Makefile.PL EXPATLIBDIR=/usr/local/lib EXPATINCDIR=/usr/local/include
When that's done, do a make to build the package then a make install to install it. There's no RPM
for this, at least that I have found. You can type exit to break out of this shell and return to the
CPAN module.

Now we need to install the XML::DOM module that wraps around the XML::Parser module. This can be 
downloaded and installed from the cpan> prompt with: install XML::DOM
