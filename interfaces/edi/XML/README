The 204.tmpl is the master 204 template that's used to send out 204 documents.

Everything in the old/ directory is just that, old. However though, those were
the original blueprints for the xmledi formats so they might have some
historical value.

The perl scripts in there (the old/ dir) were ones that were created to test 
Perl's ability to read and parse XML. Some of it might be of some use, at
least for learning Perl's XML::DOM parser and such.
