In order to conduct shipping operations over the internet with our customers, 
the need exists to somehow place the orders we receive with the carrier that
the customer selected. There are a few options for this, first is the manual
option. A person at Digiship could simply be notified that a new shipment is
ready to be booked, then would call the carrier and place the order.

The other option is to automate this somehow, and is the method that we have
chosen. Most modern carriers have the ability to send and receive EDI documents
with a VAN of some type. Of these documents, one of them is the 204 which is
basically an order or Bill Of Lading (shipment).

Now, EDI is an extremely legacy style of development and is heavily bound to 
the mainframe world. Characters in certain places, fixed length records and
all the like. We have enlisted the assistance of a VAN (Value Added Network)
to convert our messages to the legacy EDI messages that the carriers support.

On our end, we will be using XML as the source of information. XML has 
become one of the more standard methods of data representation and is widely
accepted in the EDI community.

At a high level we will place all outbound shipment orders in XML format over
the Internet to our VAN. They in turn will convert this XML order to an EDI
204 document and transmit it on to the carrier. From that point, the shipment
will be assumed to be booked. Note: functional acknowledgements are available
sometimes with an EDI 990 or 997 document.

This is the function that the BOLSender program will handle, gathering a list
of all the new shipments, turn them into XML order and send them to the VAN over
the Internet via FTP.

For the development of the XML documents, the program uses a template model
of operation. In the case of a BOL, there is a template named 204.tmpl in
this directory. This file contains the layout of the document that we have
agreed upon with our VAN. There are a series of markup tags in this file
that are identified with double % symbols. These are the tags that will be
replaced with live data upon generation of new BOL documents.

The program is extremely configurable via a text configuration file. The 
one that has been used for development and testing is called sender.cfg
and is located in this directory. It is well documented inside of itself,
so I will not go into detail here. If you wish to use an alternate config
file for the program, there is a command line parameter of --config-file
that will point BOLSender.pl to another configuration source.

While this program is meant to be run in the background and "wake up" every
once in a while, it may be run in interactive mode if needed. Simply set a
flag in the configuration file and it will ask you before it does anything.

Damn this document is old, perhaps I should update it sometime. The process
hasn't changed in 2 years though. :-)
